This repository contains the files and folders for the panda-challenge homework. The repository contains:
* Pymaceuticals folder
* Data folder (inside Pymaceuticals folder)
* Pymaceuticals jupyter notebook (inside Pymaceuticals folder)
* Mouse_metadata.csv (inside Data folder)
* Study_results.csv (inside data folder)
* Images folder 

This jupyter notebook contains:
* Mouse Total Counts
* Summary Statistics 
* Bar Chart and Pie Charts
* Quartile, Outliers and Boxplots
* Line and Scatter Plots
* Correlation and Regression

The following tasks were completed in this notebook:
* Calculated total count
* Identified and removed duplicate mouse ID
* Calculated total again
* Calculated summary statistics by using lists and creating a dataframe
* Calculated summary statistics by using groupby
* Created bar plots of total number of mice for each treatment using pandas
* Created bar plots of total number of mice for each treatment using pyplot
* Created pie plot showing the distribution of female vs. male mice by pandas
* Created pie plot showing the distribution of female vs. male mice by pyplot
* Gathered final timepoint for mice for four treatment: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
* Calculated IQR, lower bound, upper bound, and outliers for each treatment.  
* Created box plots for each treatment
* Created a line plot of timepoint vs tumor volume for a mouse being treated with Capomulin
* Created a scatter plot of mouse weight vs. average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.
* Created a plot of regression line and annotate the plot.
